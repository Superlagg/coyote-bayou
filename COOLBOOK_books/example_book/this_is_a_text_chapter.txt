This chapter is cool, cus its a .txt file. You can put as many lines as you want in this.
This line is on a new line in the file, but in the book it will be on the same line as the previous line.
Unless it ran into the edge. Then, it'll wrap around as normal. Fun fun.

This line is on a new paragraph! This is because the previous line in the file was a blank line.
This line is on the same paragraph as the previous line, because the previous line in the file was not a blank line.
Same for this line.
In the text, this is line 9.
And this is line 10.
After 20 lines in the file, the text will start a new page.
This is line 12!
And this is line 13.

Here's line 15. It's a new paragraph, because the previous line in the file was a blank line.
This is line 16. It's on the same paragraph as the previous line, because the previous line in the file was not a blank line.
This is line 17. It's on the same paragraph as the previous line, because the previous line in the file was not a blank line.
18.
19. This is line 19. Up next is 20.
Line 20! This line should be on the same page, but the next one definitely won't be. Cus it'll be on a new page.
Line 21! This line should be on a new page, cus the previous line in the file was line 20, and there are no manual page breaks.
Fenny is smelly.
Try to keep full paragraph splits away from page breaks, cus it looks weird.

THE END(?)
